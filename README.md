This repo is to document for project ideas I am toying with for my Capstone at Galvanize

### An scrobbler application from local radio stations to streaming services, synchronizing to a new playlist (e.g. the automated "Liked From Shazam" playlist in Spotify)

### A neural network to generate writing prompts to stimulate creative thinking.
