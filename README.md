# Data Science Projects (In Development)

This repo is to document for project ideas I am toying with for my Capstone at Galvanize

### A scrobbler application from local radio stations to streaming services
* Synchronizing to a new playlist 
* (e.g. the automated "Liked From Shazam" playlist in Spotify)

### A neural network to generate writing prompts
* Stimulate creative thinking
* Subsequent prompts based on user response
